  counter_offer: |
    Hi {recruiter_name},
    
    Thank you for the opportunity with {company} in {location}. The {position} role looks interesting and aligns well with my expertise in Java Selenium automation architecture.
    
    However, the offered rate of ${offered_rate}/hr is below my current market rate for architect-level positions. Based on my 10+ years of experience designing and implementing enterprise automation frameworks, CI/CD pipeline integration, and establishing architecture standards across projects, I'm targeting ${target_rate_min}-${target_rate_max}/hr.
    
    I'm confident I can deliver strong value given my extensive background in:
    - Designing scalable automation frameworks with Java and Selenium
    - Integrating test automation with CI/CD pipelines
    - Defining architecture standards for enterprise-level projects
    - Leading QA automation initiatives
    
    Would there be flexibility on the rate? If so, I'd be very interested in discussing this opportunity further.
    
    Best regards,
    Elena
