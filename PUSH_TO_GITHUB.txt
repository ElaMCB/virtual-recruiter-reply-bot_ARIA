# Commands to Push to GitHub

# After creating the repository at github.com/new with name "ai-recruiter-agent"
# Copy your repository URL (it will look like: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-recruiter-agent.git)

# Then run these commands:

# 1. Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-recruiter-agent.git

# OR if you use SSH:
# git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/ai-recruiter-agent.git

# 2. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# That's it! Your project is now on GitHub! 🎉

# To update later (after making changes):
# git add .
# git commit -m "Your commit message"
# git push
